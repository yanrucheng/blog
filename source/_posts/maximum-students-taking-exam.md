**Original Question**: [Maximum Students Taking Exam](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-students-taking-exam)
**Original Solution Post**: [Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-students-taking-exam/discuss/503558/python-15-line-simple-dp-using-yield-with-explanation)

**Idea**<br>
Starting from row 0, we enumerate all the possible combination of seats arrangements.<br>
Given a seats arrangement of row `n`, we can enumerate all the possible seats arrangement of row `n+1`.




**Function `combination_row` Explanation**




<li>Inputs:
<ul>
- `i`: the index of row
- `end`: the index of seat at row i under consideration
- `prev`: the arrangement before the current seat, represented with string. E.g. '.#.'
- `count`: the number of students seated to the left of the current position
- `front`: the seat arrangement of the previous row

- a seat arrangements at row i
- the corresponding number of students seated at row i



**Complexity**<br>
Worst Case Time Complexity: `O(2^m * n)` (performances are much better on average cases)<br>
Worst Case Space Complexity: `O(2^m)` (performances are much better on average cases)




**Python3**




```
class Solution:
    def maxStudents(self, seats):
        m, n = len(seats), len(seats[0])
        
        def combination_row(i, end=0, prev='', count=0, front=None):
            if end >= n:
                yield prev, count; return
            elif seats[i][end] == '.' and \
                    (not prev or prev[-1] == '#') and \
                    (end == 0 or front[end-1] == '#') and \
                    (end == n-1 or front[end+1] == '#'):
                yield from combination_row(i, end+1, prev+'.', count+1, front)
            yield from combination_row(i, end+1, prev+'#', count, front)
                            
        new_dp = {'#'*n:0} # base case: a dummy row at the very front, with all seats broken
        for i in range(m):
            dp, new_dp = new_dp, {}
            for p,sm in dp.items():
                for k,v in combination_row(i, front=p):
                    new_dp[k] = max(v+sm, new_dp.get(k, 0))
        return max(new_dp.values())

```



**Python3 using reduce (without comment and line break)**




```
from functools import reduce
class Solution:
    def maxStudents(self, seats):
        m, n = len(seats), len(seats[0])
        def combination_row(i, end=0, prev='', count=0, front=None):
            if end >= n:
                yield prev, count; return
            elif seats[i][end] == '.' and (not prev or prev[-1] == '#') and (end == 0 or front[end-1] == '#') and (end == n-1 or front[end+1] == '#'):
                yield from combination_row(i, end+1, prev+'.', count+1, front)
            yield from combination_row(i, end+1, prev+'#', count, front)
                            
        dp = {'#'*n:0}
        for i in range(m):
            def update(d, k, v): 
                d[k] = max(d.get(k, 0), v)
                return d
            dp = reduce(lambda x,pair:update(x,*pair), (k,v+sm) for p,sm in dp.items() for k,v in combination_row(i, front=p)), {})
        return max(dp.values()) 

```
